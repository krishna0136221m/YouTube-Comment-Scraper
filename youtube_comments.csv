"I am using HP Victus from last 5 months. I am a collage student - I study from it, edit videos, graphic designs, coding, this laptop can handle all these tasks easily additionally i played forza 3, 4 , rdr, car x pc, beam ng drive on highest settings , thermals are very good, but it was a bulky laptop not easy to carry and the screen also wobbles even in fan air . overall laptop base speed is 3.30gHz which I test in my collage is the highest among this price range"
"I am using the laptops and its good still me , brought this back in December 2024 and still not regretting it and thermals can be improved ."
"Bhaiya Kamaal hai, abhi haal filhaal mai aap ki hi videos dekh raha tha laptops ki aur HP Victus pe chaiyeh tha review aur aapne mann ki Baat padhli"
"no its true hp is trustable and locally parts mil jate hain maine apki video dekh ke msi ka laptop liya and as your review laptop was really good but i started having issues in just 1 year and by that time warrenty was already over and customer care said to come delhi to even get it checked and when i went to local store they took weeks to just get the parts and they said its taking long cause hp,dell & lenovo parts are easily available while parts for companies like msi are either not available or too expensive like i had issue in power jack original jack was coming for 9k and obviously i cant pay 9k to fix a jack for 50k laptop and then again i had some issues later on which were again handled by third party store and u know its hard to trust third party store specially in small cities so i would say u should only by laptop according to service center if your city or town have service center of msi , lenovo , asus then good go for them but if not then consider only what your city/town have"
I bought Lenovo Loq 4050 6gb i5134500HX watching your video......Got too much pleased with it thanks love u
You are one of the best and most honest reviewers on all of YouTube. I really liked your content.
"honest review, no bs, straight to the point. appreciate the honesty"
I was just looking at this laptop 2 days ago and saw your video pop up now
"In the Benchmarks And Performance part, could you please also add a real life test of opening Premiere Pro and After effects at the same time, adding a few 4k files + (motion graphics) and testing the preview, since it's the most common thing that an editor will do while editing videos? Beautiful video anyway, enjoyed it!!"
