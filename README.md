# YouTube-Comment-Scraper
This project is a Python-based tool that uses Selenium to automate the process of scraping comments from YouTube videos. Instead of relying on APIs, it performs a browser-based simulation to search for a video, open it, scroll through comments, and extract them â€” making it ideal for real-time comment extraction without API limits.
